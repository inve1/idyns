A very basic nameserver implementation in Go with storage on Redis.

Original implemented because I was annoyed with the fact that dyndns
was obsessed about making me pay and would not let me add a new hostname
with the same account. So I decided to implement my own dynamic nameserver.


WARNING
=====

The program is nowhere near finished, I just put it up here so I could
have a central location for the source. There's still quite a lot of stuff
that is not implemented or is hardcoded. I don't know if I will ever even
finish it :P

So.. don't use it [yet]
